    Done
    - Transitioned over to C++
    - Configured CMake and clang to generate executables
    - Added executable "scft.exe" to the system path
    - Read in scft files using "scft [fileName.scft]"
1/14/21 (Thursday)
    - More number types

    - Unsigned and signed types
        signedInt: int = 10
        // unsignedInt: uint = -10 //This line throws an error because uint is unsigned
        signedLong: long = -10
        unsignedLong: ulong = 10
        // Note: unsigned float and double don't exist
        // Note: arithmetic shift right is no longer necessary (automatically done base on signedness)
    v Mutability/Immutability/Const should be a property of the "variable" not the "value/type". This will help simplify a lot of things
        //The following could be a suitable alternative
        ~ x : int = 10    // mut variable
        x = 11          // this is valid because x is mutable

        y: string = "initial val"
        // y = "other val"  // This throws an error because y is defaulted to immutable

        z: int => 10
        val = z + 10 // This is valid
        z = 22       // This is not valid
    v References

            doStuffInt(iTest) //iTest is copied and no change is observed as expected
            doStuffPoint(pTest) //Point is passed by value and copied so there is no change to pTest
            doStuffPointRef(pTest) //pTest.x is now -1 because pTest is passed by reference 
        }
1/16/21 (Saturday)
    - Use mut to declare mutable variables
        val = 100
        // val = 10 //This line is not valid cause val is immutable

        mut x = 1
        x = 10 //The following two lines are valid because x is mutable
        x += 12
    - Function parameter ref mutability
        doStuff = (p: &Point) {
            // p.x = 10 //This throws an error because p is immutable 
        }
        doStuffMut = (mut p: &Point) {
            p.x = 11 //Valid code
        }
    - Comma in type declaration list after last declaration is optional
        p0 = Point.{ x <- 10, y <- 20 } //This won't throw an error
        p1 = Point.{ x <- 30, y <- 40, } //This will also no longer throw an error
    - UTF-8 support for string literals
        coolPi = "∬x ≈ 34" //Requires change to how file is read
        thing = "\u3030" //Not an actual unicode code point btw
    - Multiline string literals
        list1 = 
        "Fruit List
        - Apples
        - Orange
        - Banana"

        //list1 and list2 are equivalent
        list2 = "Fruit List\n- Apples\n- Orange\n- Banana"
    Done    
    - Worked on error handling structure and exception handling
    - Lexer now reads everything except for multi-line comments and numeric literals
    - Multiline string literals work
1/17/21 (Sunday)
    - Improved operator overloading syntax (Not finalized)
        Particle => type {
            x: int
            y: int
            operator (&self) + (other: &Particle) -> *Particle => {

            p0 = Particle.{ x -= 1, y <- 2 }
            p1 = Particle.{ x <- 3, y <- 4 }

            // res and res2 are equivalent but "p0 + p1" is obviously more succinct 
            res = p0 + p1
            // res2 = p0 Particle.+ p1
        }
    - All "raw pointers" are automatically "unique pointers"
        main = () {
            pointer: *Particle = Particle.new{}
            // copyOfPointer = pointer // Throws error because pointers can't be copied

            stackAllocated: Particle = Particle.{}
            copyOfStackAllocated = stackAllocated // This line is valid as expected, Creates copy of stackAllocated

            pointerToStack: *Particle = stackAllocated.*
            // copyOfPointerToStack = pointerToStack // For now, this is is invalid because pointers can't be copied
        }
    x Change type construction "<-" back to "="
        // Before, Particle.{ x = 4 } insinuated that x was immutably being defined to 4
        // However, with the new changes "mut x = 4" and "x = 4" both use the same assignment tokens
        // It now makes sense to go back to the original syntax
        p0 = Particle.{ x = 4, y = 3 }
1/26/21 (Tuesday)
    - Revised mutability syntax
        // place mut after the variable so that variable names are all left-aligned
        counter mut: int = 3
        counter2 mut = 10
        thing: int = 2
        counter++ // this is a valid line
        // thing = 4 // this is not a valid line

        // yet another alternative syntax 
        mutableVar |mut|: bool = true

        // yet ANOTHER alternative syntax 
        meaningOfLife ~: int = 3
        otherMeaning ~ = 4
2/9/21 (Tuesday)
    - No type promotion for numeric types
        // Must explictly cast numeric type to perform arithmetic on them
        int a = 33
        float b = 2.4

        // C/C++ as well as Java does type promotion but it seems like a code smell 
        // Note: in the long run it might be better to just implement type promotion but honestly, who knows
        // float c = a + b // This should throw an error
2/14/21 (Sunday)
    v New type definition syntax
        // Aimed to avoid ambiguity when dealing with expressions like "if randomThing == type {}"

        // The idea is that you are "creating" a new type
        // Similar syntax to type initialization: "newPoint = Point.{}
        Point = type.{
            x: int
            y: int
        }
    - "Templated" types 
        Container => type.(T: type, size: int) {
            containerSize => size
            containedItem: T
            nextItem: *T            // Pointer syntax indicating a "pointer to object of type T"
        }

        main = () {
            // Note that the passed in template values MUST be constant (compile-time known).
            // In this case, int and 55 are constant values so no compiler error
            testCont = Container.(int, 55) {}

            // testCont.containedItem = "failure" // This does not work because testCont is templated with type "int"
            testCont.containedItem = 20 // This line is valid for obvious reasons

            sysout(testCont.size) // This prints out "55" as expected
        }

    - Consider generalizing [typename].{}

    x Semi-colons are considered whitespace

        // Compiler flag to disable or enable warning output of semi-colons
        // Semi-colons should NOT be legal by default
    x Consider adding mod as a type literal: testMod = mod.{...}  modType: mod = typeof(testMod)
    v New syntax for one line function shorthand
        regular = (a: int, b: int) -> num return a + b
        shorthand = (a: int, b: int) => a + b

    - Prefix mut to declare a mutable variable declaration
        mut i = 3
        i = i + 1 // This is a legal line
        c = 4
        // c = c + 1 // This is NOT a legal line
3/10/21 (Wednesday)
    - Allow semi-colons to be affirmatively define statement ends

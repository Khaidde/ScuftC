    Done
    - Transitioned over to C++
    - Configured CMake and clang to generate executables
    - Added executable "scft.exe" to the system path
    - Read in scft files using "scft [fileName.scft]"

1/14/21 (Thursday)
    Notes
    - More number types
        main = () {
            stdInteger: int = 2_147_483_647
            stdLong: long = 9_223_372_036_854_775_807

            stdFloat: float = 3.14
            stdDouble: double = 3.1415926535
        }
    - Try to create a semi-colon free language (Or maybe they can be optional)
        doStuff = (a: int) {
            return a * a
        }
        doOther = (a: int) -> int {
            val = 10 
            return val + a
        }

        a = doStuff(3)
        b = doOther(10)
        Particle => type {
            a: int ~= 10
            b: string ~= "val"
        }

        //New line tokens don't matter in type construction
        part = Particle.{
            a <- 4,
            b <- "test"
        }

        //New line tokens also don't matter for single statement if/else/while/for 
        val: bool = true $$ true
        if val doStuff(10) else doOther(10)
        if val
            doOther(20)
        else { //The following is also valid
            doStuff(20)
            doStuff(40) 
        }


    - Blocks can act as statements
        // running main leads to a console log of "10" and "11" with no errors
        main = () {
            {
                dup = 10
                sysout(dup)
            }
            dup = 11
            sysout(dup)
        }
    - Remove default function parameters (function parameters are no longer declarations)
    - Remove default intialization values for type definitions
            Particle => type {
                // x: mut int = 4 This line is not longer valid because default values are not allowed
                x: int
                y: int
                id: mut int
            }
1/15/21 (Friday)
    Notes
    - Unsigned and signed types
        signedInt: int = 10
        // unsignedInt: uint = -10 //This line throws an error because uint is unsigned
        signedLong: long = -10
        unsignedLong: ulong = 10
        // Note: unsigned float and double don't exist
        // Note: arithmetic shift right is no longer necessary (automatically done base on signedness)
    - Mutability/Immutability/Const should be a property of the "variable" not the "value/type". This will help simplify a lot of things
        //The following could be a suitable alternative
        ~ x : int = 10    // mut variable
        x = 11          // this is valid because x is mutable

        y: string = "initial val"
        // y = "other val"  // This throws an error because y is defaulted to immutable

        z: int => 10
        val = z + 10 // This is valid
        z = 22       // This is not valid
    - References
        Point => type { 
            x: int 
            y: int
            ~randFlag : bool 
        }
        doStuff = (p: &Point) {
            p.randFlag = false
        }
        main = () {
            newPoint = Point.{
                x <- 10,
                y <- 11,    
                randFlag <- true
            }
            sysout(newPoint.randFlag) //
            doStuff(newPoint)
        }
    - Pass by value vs pass by reference
        doStuffInt = (i: int) {
            i = -1
        }
        doStuffPoint = (p: Point) {
            p.x = -1
        }
        doStuffPointRef = (p: &Point) { //Assume that p is mutable somehow (Haven't figured this out yet) 
            p.x = -1
        }
        main = () {
            iTest = 20
            pTest = Point.{ x <- 22 }

            doStuffInt(iTest) //iTest is copied and no change is observed as expected
            doStuffPoint(pTest) //Point is passed by value and copied so there is no change to pTest
            doStuffPointRef(pTest) //pTest.x is now -1 because pTest is passed by reference 
        }

1/16/21 (Saturday)
    Notes
    - Use mut to declare mutable variables
        val = 100
        // val = 10 //This line is not valid cause val is immutable

        mut x = 1
        x = 10 //The following two lines are valid because x is mutable
        x += 12
    - Function parameter ref mutability
        doStuff = (p: &Point) {
            // p.x = 10 //This throws an error because p is immutable 
        }
        doStuffMut = (mut p: &Point) {
            p.x = 11 //Valid code
        }
    - Comma in type declaration list after last declaration is optional
        p0 = Point.{ x <- 10, y <- 20 } //This won't throw an error
        p1 = Point.{ x <- 30, y <- 40, } //This will also no longer throw an error
    - UTF-8 support for string literals
        coolPi = "∬x ≈ 34" //Requires change to how file is read
        thing = "\u3030" //Not an actual unicode code point btw
    - Multiline string literals
        list1 = 
        "Fruit List
        - Apples
        - Orange
        - Banana"

        //list1 and list2 are equivalent
        list2 = "Fruit List\n- Apples\n- Orange\n- Banana"
    
    Done    
    - Worked on error handling structure and exception handling
    - Lexer now reads everything except for multi-line comments and numeric literals
    - Multiline string literals work

1/17/21 (Sunday)
    Notes
    - Improved operator overloading syntax (Not finalized)
        Particle => type {
            x: int
            y: int
            operator (&self) + (other: &Particle) -> *Particle => {
                return Particle.new{ 
                    x <- self.x + other.x, 
                    y <- self.y + other.y,
                }
            }
        }
        main = () {
            p0 = Particle.{ x -= 1, y <- 2 }
            p1 = Particle.{ x <- 3, y <- 4 }

            // res and res2 are equivalent but "p0 + p1" is obviously more succinct 
            res = p0 + p1
            // res2 = p0 Particle.+ p1
        }
    - All "raw pointers" are automatically "unique pointers"
        main = () {
            pointer: *Particle = Particle.new{}
            // copyOfPointer = pointer // Throws error because pointers can't be copied

            stackAllocated: Particle = Particle.{}
            copyOfStackAllocated = stackAllocated // This line is valid as expected, Creates copy of stackAllocated

            pointerToStack: *Particle = stackAllocated.*
            // copyOfPointerToStack = pointerToStack // For now, this is is invalid because pointers can't be copied
        }
    - Change type construction "<-" back to "="
        // Before, Particle.{ x = 4 } insinuated that x was immutably being defined to 4
        // However, with the new changes "mut x = 4" and "x = 4" both use the same assignment tokens
        // It now makes sense to go back to the original syntax
        p0 = Particle.{ x = 4, y = 3 }

1/26/21 (Tuesday)
    Notes
    - Revised mutability syntax
        // place mut after the variable so that variable names are all left-aligned
        counter mut: int = 3
        counter2 mut = 10
        thing: int = 2
        counter++ // this is a valid line
        // thing = 4 // this is not a valid line

        // yet another alternative syntax 
        mutableVar |mut|: bool = true

        // yet ANOTHER alternative syntax 
        meaningOfLife ~: int = 3
        otherMeaning ~ = 4

2/9/21 (Tuesday)
    Notes
    - No type promotion for numeric types
        // Must explictly cast numeric type to perform arithmetic on them
        int a = 33
        float b = 2.4

        // C/C++ as well as Java does type promotion but it seems like a code smell 
        // Note: in the long run it might be better to just implement type promotion but honestly, who knows
        // float c = a + b // This should throw an error

2/14/21 (Sunday)
    Notes
    - New type definition syntax
        // Aimed to avoid ambiguity when dealing with expressions like "if randomThing == type {}"

        // The idea is that you are "creating" a new type
        // Similar syntax to type initialization: "newPoint = Point.{}
        Point = type.{
            x: int
            y: int
        }
    - "Templated" types 
        Container => type.(T: type, size: int) {
            containerSize => size
            containedItem: T
            nextItem: *T            // Pointer syntax indicating a "pointer to object of type T"
        }

        main = () {
            // Note that the passed in template values MUST be constant (compile-time known).
            // In this case, int and 55 are constant values so no compiler error
            testCont = Container.(int, 55) {}

            // testCont.containedItem = "failure" // This does not work because testCont is templated with type "int"
            testCont.containedItem = 20 // This line is valid for obvious reasons

            sysout(testCont.size) // This prints out "55" as expected
        }

2/18/21 (Thursday)
    Notes
    - Consider generalizing [typename].{}
        // [typename].{...} means create an instance of [typename] and 
        // use the block as if you were calling from within the type's scope
        point = Point.{ x = 3 y = x + 5 }
        point2 = Point.{
            instanceVal: int = 10
            x = 4

            if true {
                y = 1 + instanceVal
            } else {
                y = 0
            }
        }

        // This makes the type definition syntax make more sense
        Particle => type.{
            x: int
            y: int
        }
    - Semi-colons are considered whitespace
        // Both statements are valid
        a: int = 4
        b: int = 5; 

        // Compiler flag to disable or enable warning output of semi-colons
        // Semi-colons should NOT be legal by default
    - Consider adding mod as a type literal: testMod = mod.{...}  modType: mod = typeof(testMod)
    - New syntax for one line function shorthand
        regular = (a: int, b: int) -> num return a + b
        shorthand = (a: int, b: int) => a + b
    - Consider implicit return types
        funcTest = (a: int, b: int) return a + b  // Implicit return type of int

        // This function throws an error because of return type mismatch
        fancy = () {
            if true {
                return 1
            } else {
                return "value"
            }
        }
    - Use ty and mod keyword to remove ambiguity
        Utils = mod {
            Point => ty {
                x: int
                y: int
            }
            Container => ty (T: type) {
                item: T 
                lifetime: int
            }
            testPoint = Point.{
                x = 3
                y = 5
            }
        }

3/7/21 (Sunday)
    - Use :: to for function shortcut
        add = (a: int, b: int) :: a + b
        three = () :: 3 
    - Labeled while loops
        //Syntax due to change
        while(outer) true {
            while(inner) true {
                if doStuff() {
                    break outer
                } else {
                    continue outer
                }
            }
        }
    - Infinite for loop syntax
        mut i = 3
        for {
            i = i + 1
            if i > 10 {
                break
            }
        }
    - Prefix mut to declare a mutable variable declaration
        mut i = 3
        i = i + 1 // This is a legal line
        c = 4
        // c = c + 1 // This is NOT a legal line
3/10/21 (Wednesday)
    - Allow semi-colons to be affirmatively define statement ends
        // pointA and pointB are equivalent
        pointA = Point.{ x = 3; y = 4 }
        pointB = Point.{ x = 3 y = 4 }

        // a is interpretted as a function while b is interpretted as a functionType with proceeding block statement
        a = () -> bool {
            doStuff()
        }
        b = () -> bool;
        {
            doOtherStuff()
        }
